Melvin had done some of the data retrival prior to us meeting.

Desi and I met Sunday and were able to get through most of the homework. He did a lot of the coding while I helped proofread,
debug, and talk him through sections we got stuck on.

Theo, Cat, and Melvin met separately during the same time and we all communicated through GroupMe for the more
difficult parts.

We all worked together to get eachother caught up on Monday and Tuesday.

Extensive conversations were had over GroupMe to help eachother finish up the last part of Homework and Lab.
