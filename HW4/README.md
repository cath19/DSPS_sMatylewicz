We all met on Saturday and spent the majority of the day in Spencer working on this homework. 

Most of the code was written by Desi although we all worked together through every portion and discussed a lot along the way.
Cat wrote most of the docstrings.

I helped Desi discuss through roadblocks to keep the project moving, and helped the other group members debug code while Desi pushed ahead.

We then all worked together to get the Milky Way portion of the code running.
