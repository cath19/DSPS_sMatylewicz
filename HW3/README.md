We all met up on Saturday and spend 9 hours in Sharp Lab working on the Homework and did not finish.
We will have to meet up again for further work.

Desi and Theo did a good job leading the group, and everyone contributed to every portion of the project.
We all had discussions and helped eachother code throughout the entire homework.

I went to Yuqi's office hours, just to waste an hour because he did not understand the problem any more
than we did.

Desi talked with Dr. Bianca and shared the messages with our group and this did not help us either.

We worked on the project all night while discussing over GroupMe until I eventually turned in unsatisfying results.
